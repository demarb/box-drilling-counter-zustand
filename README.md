# box-drilling-counter-zustand

## Project Overview:

A project to test setting up a global store for react states using zustand. The project has three box components nested within each other. Each component has a counter and increment or decrement its own counter and its children counter. A redux version of this is also avalable here : https://github.com/demarb/box-drilling-counter-redux . The only difference with this version is that we are using zustand persist middleware to save store.
